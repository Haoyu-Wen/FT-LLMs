The attribute that most Internet crimes have in common is anonymity. Criminals hide behind screen names when perpetrating their crimes and feel safe from apprehension and punishment in doing so because other Internet users cannot learn their true identities, and jurisdictional and budget issues make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to enforce existing laws. Clearly, the only way to reduce such crime in the future is to create a system that requires Internet users to provide their true identities and full contact information in a way that is visible to all other users.\n\nquestion:\nThe flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to which of the following?\n\nchoices:\n0:Crimes involving deception are on the increase at the same time that crimes of violence seem to be decreasing. Law enforcement techniques in the past have focused primarily on the prevention and detection of violent crime. However, it is now clear that new techniques are required to combat crimes such as Internet fraud. Law enforcement agencies will have to focus on recruiting, hiring, and training a larger proportion of computer literate officers if they hope to keep up with modern criminals.\n1:Most states carefully regulate the possession of exotic wild animals as pets. Specially trained officers often raid illicit breeding operations and seize proscribed animals such as chimpanzees and tigers. Although these species are capable of becoming dangerous, individuals are still drawn to them as pets. The fact that their possession is unlawful is an inadequate deterrent. Since prohibitions on ownership are clearly not eliminating the black market in exotic species, the focus should turn to education of the public regarding the dangers of such pets.\n2:Wildlife biologists report that the population of the Northern Rock Fish is reaching dangerously low levels. The decrease in population is attributed to over fishing by unethical anglers who ignore laws regulating the size and number of the species that may be taken from rivers and streams. Poachers know that there are insufficient numbers of enforcement officers to create a credible threat of apprehension. It is obvious to authorities that the only way to save the species is to implement a total ban on the fishing of Northern Rock Fish immediately.\n3:When surveyed in prison, the majority of convicted violent criminals report that they have made decisions during their criminal careers to avoid at least one potential victim because of fears that the potential victim might be armed. Even when the criminals themselves are armed, they tend to prefer unarmed victims. Add to this the fact that statistics reveal that complete bans on private weapons in some jurisdictions have failed to eliminate violent crime and the fact that many jurisdictions with a high proportion of private weapon ownership enjoy a very low crime rate, and one may conclude that public policy should favor the private ownership of weapons.\n\n\n", "input": "", "output": "1.

Therefore, this choice is strongly supported by the given information.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate choice 2\nThis choice implies that electrical utility companies typically increase the electrical load on their transmission lines on days when the wind has a strong cooling effect. However, there is no information in the context to support this claim, so it is not strongly supported by the given information.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate choice 3\nThis choice states that transmission lines that run parallel to the prevailing winds can generally carry greater electrical loads than otherwise identical lines at a right angle to the prevailing winds. While wind direction is mentioned in the context, there is no specific information about the impact of wind direction on the electrical load that a transmission line can carry. Therefore, this choice is not strongly supported by the given information.\n\nStep 6: Choose the most strongly supported choice\nBased on the given information, choice 1 is the most strongly supported.

Review the objection: The objection is questioning the assumption made in the argument. In this case, it's asking us to consider if the assumption that the Ptolemaic and Copernican theories, being inconsistent, cannot both be false.\n\n3. Consider the choices:\n   - Choice 0: This choice is not relevant to the assumption being questioned in the argument.\n   - Choice 1: This choice is not directly challenging the assumption about the inconsistency of the theories.\n   - Choice 2: This choice directly addresses the assumption in question, stating that the argument assumes that the Ptolemaic and Copernican theories, being inconsistent, cannot both be false. This aligns with the objection raised.\n   - Choice 3: This choice is also not directly challenging the assumption about the inconsistency of the theories.\n  \n4. Select the answer: Based on the consideration of the choices, it becomes clear that Choice 2 directly addresses the questionable assumption made in the argument. Therefore, the correct answer is 2: the Ptolemaic and Copernican theories, being inconsistent, cannot both be false."}, {"instruct": "context:\nA group of mountain climbers was studied to determine how they were affected by diminished oxygen in the air at high altitudes.

Identify the main argument: The argument is that the combination of worsened performances in speech, comprehension, and reasoning disproves the theory that the area of the brain controlling speech is distinct from that controlling other functions.\n\n2. Evaluate the vulnerability of the argument: The argument can be criticized if it overlooks the possibility that there is a common factor affecting all of the climbers' performance in speech, comprehension, and reasoning.\n\n3. Analyze the choices:\n- Choice 0: This choice suggests that the climbers' performance in speech, comprehension, and reasoning was impaired because oxygen deprivation affected their entire brains, which directly addresses the possibility identified in step 2.\n- Choice 1: This choice introduces the idea of special training, which is not directly related to the vulnerability of the argument.\n- Choice 2: This choice suggests that the climbers' performance was better than average before the study, which does not address the vulnerability of the argument.\n- Choice 3: This choice suggests that some of the effects were apparent just before the climbers reached 6,100 meters, which does not directly address the vulnerability of the argument.\n\n4.
